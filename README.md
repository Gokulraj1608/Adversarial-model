# Adversarial Attack Analysis and Defense Mechanisms for Deep Learning-Based Intrusion Detection Systems in Software-Defined Networks
## Here a deep learning model for SDN is built based on DDoS dataset CSE-CIC-IDS-2018 - https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html. 
## The DNN model is attacked using projected gradient descent (PGD) attack using the functions available in ART. https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox
## The adversarial training of model is done using adversarial training function in ART
## To compare the adversarial trained model and normal model, WGAN is used to generate the adversarial samples and test on each models.
